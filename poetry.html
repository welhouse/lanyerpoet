Great learned Ladie, whom I long haue knowne,
And yet not knowne so much as I desired:
Rare Phoenix, whose faire feathers are your owne,
With which you flie, and are so much admired:
True honour whom true Fame hath so attired, 
In glittering raiment shining much more bright, 
Than siluer Starres in the most frostie night.

And cast your eyes vpon this little Booke,

Vpon this humbled King, who all forsooke, 
That in his dying armes he might imbrace 
Your beauteous Soule, and fill it with his grace.

  <h2> To the Doubtfull Reader </h2>
  <h3> BY ÆMILIA LANYER </h3>
  <pre>
  Gentle Reader, if thou desire to be resolued, why I 
giue this Title, Salue Deus Rex Judaeorum, know 
for certaine, that it was deliuered vnto me in sleepe 
many yeares before I had any intent to write in this 
maner, and was quite out of my memory vntill I had written 
the Passion of Christ, when immediately it came into my re- 
membrance, what I had dreamed long before; and thinking 
it a significant token, that I was appointed to performe that 
Worke, I gaue the very same words I receiued in sleepe as the 
fittest Title I could deuise for this Booke.

  <h2> Eve's Apology in Defense of Women</h2>

<h3> Excerpted from <em> Salve Deus Rex Judćorum </em> </h3>
<h3> BY ÆMILIA LANYER</h3>

    <pre>
But surely Adam can not be excused, 
Her fault though great, yet he was most to blame; 
What Weakness offered, Strength might have refused, 
Being Lord of all, the greater was his shame:                 780 
Although the Serpent's craft had her abused, 
God's holy word ought all his actions frame, 
    For he was Lord and King of all the earth, 
    Before poore Eve had either life or breath.   

Who being framed by God's eternal hand,                      785 
The perfectest man that ever breathed on earth; 
And from God's mouth received that straight command, 
The breach whereof he knew was present death: 
Yea having power to rule both Sea and Land, 
Yet with one Apple won to loose that breath                   790 
    Which God had breathed in his beauteous face, 
    Bringing us all in danger and disgrace.  
    </pre>

  <div class="col-md-6">

And then to lay the fault on Patience' back, 
That we (poor women) must endure it all; 
We know right well he did discretion lack,                      795 
Being not persuaded thereunto at all; 
If Eve did err, it was for knowledge' sake, 
The fruit being fair persuaded him to fall: 
    No subtle Serpent's falsehood did betray him, 
    If he would eat it, who had power to stay him?           800 
   
Not Eve, whose fault was only too much love, 
Which made her give this present to her Dear, 
That what she tasted, he likewise might prove, 
Whereby his knowledge might become more clear; 
He never sought her weakeness to reprove,                   805 
With those sharp words, which he of God did hear: 
    Yet Men will boast of Knowledge, which he took 
    From Eve's fair hand, as from a learned Book.
